;;; Commentary:

;; This package does two things.  First, it extends Magit's UI with
;; assorted GitHub-related functionality, similar to the github-gem
;; tool (http://github.com/defunkt/github-gem).  Second, it uses
;; Magit's excellent Git library to build an Elisp library for
;; interfacing with GitHub's API.
